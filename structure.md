📌 Folder Explanation

- basics/ → Core Python fundamentals including variables, data types (int, float, string, boolean), input/output operations, operators (arithmetic, comparison), conditional statements (if-else), loops (for and while), and functions. Essential for building a strong foundation in Python programming.
- collections/ → Data structures like lists (mutable sequences), tuples (immutable sequences), sets (unordered unique elements), and dictionaries (key-value pairs). Crucial for handling and organizing data efficiently in Python applications.
- advanced/ → Advanced topics such as file handling (reading/writing files), exception handling (try-except blocks), and modules/packages (importing and organizing code). Important for robust, error-free, and modular Python programs.
- mini_projects/ → Small real-world Python projects including a calculator, number guessing game, and student management system. Provides hands-on experience applying Python concepts to practical scenarios.
- practice/ → Practice programs and interview questions to reinforce learning and prepare for coding interviews. Includes basic programs and common questions to build problem-solving skills.
- requirements.txt → File listing external libraries or dependencies needed for the project (if any). Used with pip to install required packages for running the code.
